This is the basic form of our branding, the CactusDev Cactus. This can be placed on 3 different backgrounds.

## Branding colors

The Cactus is made up of 3 different colors:

&nbsp;#83bf4f &nbsp;&nbsp; #49612f &nbsp;&nbsp; #699635

You can put the cactus logo on 3 different colors:

&nbsp;<img src="colors/2e3136.png" width="48">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="colors/000000.png" width="48">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="colors/ffffff.png" width="48">
